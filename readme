#The app is not complete though allows the user to do the basics, i.e login,post articles, read articles and rate then
#I am using this project to try out concepts that are new to me, that is
                                   *mvc
                                   *pdo-for the database
                                   *jquery and bootstrap libraries for the front end
#my way of dealing with mvc *may* not be correct but it does work and as much as possible tries to apply DRY
           #there are parts that have forced me to ignore dry e.g the inclusion if header and footer files in each view file.
#basically this is how my mvc structure is set up.
           VIEW ---------> CONTROLLER ----------->MODEL----------->CONTROLLER---------->VIEW
           * the view talks to the controller, controller to the model , model responds to the controller , controller updates the view
           *in some cases the model is not "talked" to especially when we do not need any data from the database.eg during validation.
